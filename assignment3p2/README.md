## Adding a firewall and a Reverse Proxy Server

Welcome One and All to the BEST (potentially false) guide you'll see. In this Guide i will be showing you how to add a firewall and reverse proxy server to the one I previouslly showed you how to set up.

## Step 1 - downloading the binary backend and putting it onto your computer

First you will download the hello-server file (in this folder) onto your host computer

Next you will connect with your linux machine with sftp (ran on your host computer)

Replace the IP with your own machines IP

```shell
sftp -i ~/.ssh/do-key aiden@64.23.155.88
